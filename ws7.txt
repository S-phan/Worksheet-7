  they realize that these pants were the start of something special.  immediatley following they decided to make up certian rules abut the pants such as you must write the best thing u did while wearing the pants over your summer on the right leg and also some silly things such as to \\"never pick yuor nose while wearing the pants.\\"  this book follows the girls throuh their summers in differnt places of the world and through all of the different obstacles that life takes them through. it can really teach you alot not only about what is going on around you but most imporntantly about yuorself.  i would give this book 4 stars and would reccommend it to anyone who seems the slihgtest bit interested.	2005-10-14
